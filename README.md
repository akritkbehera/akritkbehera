[![Hi there!](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4684U.png)](https://github.com/akritkbehera/akritkbehera)

I'm a final year Computer Science student with a passion for learning and exploring various tech stacks. My journey has led me to dive into languages like Java and Python, along with frameworks like Spring Boot. I'm also delving into the realms of DevOps, Machine Learning, and even iOS Development.

As I approach the end of my academic journey, I'm excited to channel my skills into real-world projects and collaborations. If you're working on projects related to any of the technologies I've been learning, I'd love to join forces and contribute. Making my first contribution to the open-source community is a goal I'm actively pursuing, and I'm open to guidance and collaboration from fellow enthusiasts.
